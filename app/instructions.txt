1. Signature Spoofing
Why? Required to prevent the risk of mod detection and thereby causing account ban.
How? Modify real time signature checks with that of a static signature. This signature is generated from one of the previous versions of official release. In addition to this, replace the hash value from corresponding base version file.
Procedure:
Find Landroid/content/pm/PackageInfo;->signatures:[Landroid/content/pm/Signature; line
Replace
invoke-static {}, Lorg/teamb58/whatsappmini/SignatureSpoof;->Signatures()[Landroid/content/pm/Signature;

move-result-object v1

Find Landroid/content/pm/Signature;->toByteArray()[B line
Replace invoke-static {}, Lorg/teamb58/whatsappmini/SignatureSpoof;->Signature()[B
